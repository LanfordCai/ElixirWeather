# Weather

This is an Elixir demo for the purpose of practice, which is used to show the **current weather condition/air quality/weather forecasting in recent seven days** of a specified city in **China**

For any directories contains the file `weather`, execute `./weather cityname` in Terminal, then you get the weather info you want.

There are something should be noticed:
1. This app can only run on the computers which have Erlang installed.
2. The cityname should be in Chinese, for example, `./weather 广州` rather than `./weather Guangzhou`
